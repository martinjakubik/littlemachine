                <h1>What is Little Machine?</h1>
                <p>Little Machine is a very, very, very tiny AI.</p>
                <p>So tiny that you should be able to look at its little brain.</p>
                <p>It can do tiny things, but it's really made so that you can see how an AI works.</p>
                <p>Because while Little Machine is tiny, it really is an AI, and it can do things that big AIs can do (just not as fast, and... well not that big either).</p>

            <div class="step" id="why" data-x="2000">
                <h1>Why did we make Little Machine?</h1>
                <p>Little Machine is here so you can learn how AI works.</p>
                <p>Everybody talks about how AI is so complicated and you need to be such an expert scientist to use it, and they use big words to talk about it.</p>
                <p>But in spite of the big words, AI is really made by adding and adding lots of numbers, and multiplication.</p>
                <p>Like 1 + 1 + 1 and 2 x 2 x 2.</p>
                <p>What's "complicated", and daunting, about AI is that they do millions and millions of those additions and multiplications.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, what's encouraging is that there is no complex math in AI, like probablities or calculus or imaginary numbers or p-adic rings.</p>
                <p>And that's why we made Little Machine. To make the smallest little AI, so that we could actually watch it do its little additions and multiplications, but at the end of which, it would learn to do something useful.</p>

            <div class="step" id="whatItDoes" data-x="3000">
                <h1>What Little Machine does</h1>
                <p>Little Machine learns to see. It learns to recognize little faces.</p>
                <p>We made thousands of tiny, tiny images, 5 by 5 pixel squares, and we let you show them to Little Machine until it learns to recognize faces.</p>
                <p>Once you're done "teaching" Little Machine, we let you show it a new picture, and it will tell you if it recognizes a face.</p>
                <p>The cool thing is that you can look at what its "brain" looks like after you're done teaching, or even during teaching.</p>
